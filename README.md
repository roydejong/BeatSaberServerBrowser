## Installation
üëâ **Server Browser is *usually* available on [ModAssistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/blob/master/README.md), which is the easiest way to install it!**

You can also install the mod manually by following the instructions below.

If you need help, you can ask in the [Beat Saber Modding Group](https://discord.com/invite/beatsabermods) Discord (#pc-help) or [BeatTogether Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gezGrFG4tz) (#help).

### Requirements

- Beat Saber 1.29+ on PC (Steam or Oculus)
- With the latest version of the following mods:
  - Core mods (BSIPA and SongCore) 
  - SiraUtil 
  - BeatSaberMarkupLanguage
  - MultiplayerCore

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Compatibility note:** Check the GitHub releases for up-to-date information on Beat Saber compatibility and older supported versions. The mod usually doesn't require updates after a new game version drops.  

### Download
You can download the latest release directly from GitHub:

[**Download latest release**](https://github.com/roydejong/BeatSaberServerBrowser/releases/latest)

Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your Beat Saber installation directory.

If the mod is installed successfully, you should see `ServerBrowser.dll` in your Beat Saber `Plugins` directory. It will only load if you also have the right dependencies like MultiplayerCore.

## How it works

### Joining games
Open the Online menu, then click on the "Server Browser" button. From there, you'll see all public multiplayer games. Click on a game, and then select "Connect" to jump right in.

### Sharing games
When creating a server, you'll see the option to add it to the Server Browser. You can also set a custom name for the game if you want.

If you're the party leader or lobby owner, you can control these settings from the Gameplay Modifiers panel as well. This is located on the left side of the lobby.

**If you share your game on the Server Browser, anyone will be able to join! Your server code will be publicly visible on the site (https://bssb.app) as well.**

## Custom Songs
Want to play Custom Songs in Beat Saber Multiplayer? Here's what you'll need:

- **A modded copy of Beat Saber 1.22+**
- **[MultiplayerCore](https://github.com/Goobwabber/MultiplayerCore):** This mod makes multiplayer modding possible, and makes custom songs work.
- **[BeatTogether]()**: BeatTogether provides multiplayer servers that allow modded content to work.

The Server Browser mod isn't required for custom songs, but it's here to help you find multiplayer lobbies.

The [MultiplayerExtensions](https://github.com/Goobwabber/MultiplayerExtensions) mod adds additional multiplayer features and is recommended but not required anymore.

Here's some important things you should know:
- Official servers do **NOT** allow Custom Songs at all; it doesn't matter what mods you have.
- The BeatTogether mod will let you choose which master server to play on. Make sure you choose BeatTogether or another modded master server if you want to play custom songs!

If you need more help, you can ask in the [BeatTogether Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gezGrFG4tz) (#help).

## Cross-play
Beat Saber has enabled cross-play for all platforms on official servers. Unofficial servers like BeatTogether always allow cross play. You'll encounter both Steam and Oculus players when you play.

Please note that different versions of Beat Saber may not be compatible. Make sure everyone is on the same game version for the best experience.
